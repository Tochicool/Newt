word: exemplar definition with [keywords] marked

Velocity: the [rate of change] of [displacement]

Acceleration: as the object approaches the speed of light, the mass of the object increases

#Motion
Displacement: [net] distance moved in a particular direction

Instantaneous speed: speed measured between two points a very small time apart

Average speed: [distance] covered per time taken

Velocity: rate of change of [displacement]

Acceleration: rate of change of [velocity]

Reaction Time: time taken to react to [stimuli]

Thinking distance: The distance travelled from when the driver sees a problem and the [brakes] are applied

Braking distance: The distance travelled  whilst the brakes are applied and the car stops

stopping distance: thinking distance + stopping distance

#Forces & Vectors
a Scalar quantity: a quantity that has a [magnitude] without [direction]

a Vector quantity: a quantity that has [both] magnitude / size and [direction]

Drag: the frictional force experienced by an object travelling through a fluid

Terminal velocity: when the weight of an object equals the drag force

the Moment of a Force: force x [perpendicular] distance from pivot

the Torque of a Couple: [one] of forces × perpendicular distance

Density: mass per unit volume

Pressure: force per unit area

#Energy
Work Done: force x distance [moved] in the direction of the force

the Principle of Conservation of Energy: energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred into other forms

#Materials
Elastic Deformation: extension (or compression) where material will return to its original length

Plastic Deformation: Material does not return to original length

Hooke's Law: Extension is proportional to force (applied)

#Newton's laws & Momentum
Newton’s First Law of Motion: A body will remain at rest or continue to move with
constant velocity unless acted upon by a force

Newton’s Second Law of Motion: Force is proportional to the rate of change of momentum

Newton’s Third Law of Motion: When one body exerts a force on another, the other body
exerts an equal in magnitude and opposite in direction force on the first body

Linear Momentum: the product of mass and velocity ; momentum is a vector

Net Force on a Body: proportional to the rate of change of momentum

Impulse of a Force: Product of force acting on a body and the time its acting; equal to the rate of change of momentum

the Principle of Conservation of Momentum: Total momentum is conserved for a closed system

a Perfectly Elastic Collision: A collision with no loss of kinetic energy

an Inelastic Collision: Some loss of kinetic energy during the collision
